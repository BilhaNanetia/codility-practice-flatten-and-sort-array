# Flatten and sort Two-Dimensional array
## Description
This Javascript function takes a two-dimensional array of integers, flattens it into a single-dimensional array and returns the sorted version of the flattened array in ascending order.
## Example
### Input:
[[3, 2, 1], [4, 6, 5], [], [9, 7, 8]]
### Output:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
## Solution Overview
The `flattenAndSort` function takes a two-dimensional array as input and returns a sorted single-dimensional array.In this function:
* The empty sub-array (`[]`) is first filtered out . 
* Use `reduce()` along with `concat()` to flatten the two-dimensional array into a single array.
* Use `sort()` to sort the flattened array in ascending order.
